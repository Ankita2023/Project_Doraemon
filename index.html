    Doraemon (Japanese: ドラえもん [doɾaemoɴ]) was a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Fujiko F. Fujio. 
    The manga was first serialized in December 1969, with its 1,345 individual chapters compiled into 45 tankōbon volumes and published by Shogakukan from 1970 to 1996. 
    The story revolves around an earless robotic cat named Doraemon, who travels back in time from the 22nd century to aid a boy named Nobita Nobi.
    Nobita Nobi is a ten-year-old around Japanese school boy, who is kind-hearted and honest, but also lazy, unlucky, weak, and bad grades and sports. 
    One day, a robot cat from the 22nd century named Doraemon was sent back to the past by Nobita's descendants to take care of Nobita, so that his descendants can get a better life.
    Then Doraemon became his best friend and family.
    Doraemon has a four-dimensional pouch in which he stores unexpected future technology gadgets he uses to aid Nobita.
    Doraemon is mainly aimed at children, so Fujio chose to create the character with a simple graphic style, based on shapes such as circles and ellipses.
    He used the same sequences of cartoons with regularity and continuity to enhance the reader's ease of understanding. 
    In addition, blue, a characteristic color of Doraemon, was chosen as the main color in magazine publications, which used to have a yellow cover and red title.
    Set in Tokyo, the manga reflected parts of Japan's society, such as the class system and the "ideal" of Japanese childhood.
    Problems, if occur, were resolved in a way so as not to rely on violence and eroticism, and the stories were integrated with the concept of environmentalism.
    The manga also insisted on the ethical values of integrity, perseverance, courage, family and respect.

<h3> Doraemon</h3>
<p>Doraemon was manufactured Matsushiba Robot Factory on 2112, bearing the code MS-903. He was damaged by an electrical bolt during production which detached a critical screw from him, degrading his abilities in general while crippling a variety of external attachments.Being a machine, he does not have some average needs of a regular person, whatever he consumes is automatically converted to energy within his nuclear furnace.</p>
<h3> Nobita</h3>
<p>Nobita is the hero at best and the villain at worst. At the beginning of the series, Nobita is a rather lazy person who has a cycle of constantly napping after school, keeping him up late when he wakes up late for school. This cycle of laziness occurs almost every day, keeping him up late at night and wake up late the next morning, hindering him academically. Nobita is very dependent on Doraemon and begs for multiple things, much to his disapproval. Many things that Nobita wishes for include; vengeance on his bullies, a better product than what Suneo brags about, and privileges.</p>
<h3> Shizuka</h3>
<p>Shizuka is a smart and kind neighbourhood girl. She is, unlike Nobita, a quick-witted and very studious child. Shizuka loves to bathe and does it several times a day passionately. Unlike Nobita, Suneo, and Gian, she is not a fan of video games for the most part.She cares for weaker people, abused animals and neglected dolls. She wishes to be a nurse or an air-hostess when she grows up. Both jobs reflect her kind nature. Shizuka loves her dolls a lot, to the extent that she loves them more than her own friends.</p>
<h3>Sunio</h3>
<p>Suneo's personality is described as a cunning, prideful, cocky, arrogant, and narcissistic, as he always brags about unusual (and expensive) stuff including toys, comics, etc, he often brags about his dad's position as a president director of a company and holds a deep respect towards him (he wants to be the successor of the company). His highest and most "easy-to-see" personality is narcissism, in which often he likes to look in the mirror and talk about how handsome he is (like the queen in Snow White). Some of the stories start with Suneo showing off some new video game or toy which evokes Nobita's envy and irritation. He has extensive knowledge of science and is a talented artist and designer.</p>
<h3>Giyan</h3>
<p>Gian is known for his overconfidence and is terrible in singing and cooking skills, of which he constantly abuses to torture his surroundings, as he was never aware of these flaws. He is tone deaf to the horrendous singing as shown in some episodes where he sing and totally unaffected by it.
 Gian's favorite food is stuffed capsicum.Being a bully, he often steals or robs toys and manga under the pretext of "borrowing" them, unless the target is damaged. Save for a select few episodes and films in general, Gian is usually the main antagonist, but occasionally allies himself with other characters as well and is willing to help, if possible. </p>
